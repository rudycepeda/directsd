Usually this extrapolatoruses only the last value of the control sequence so that<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/gh_ut.gif" WIDTH=264 HEIGHT=22 ALT=""></CENTER>where <span class=tms>h</span>(<span class=tms>t</span>) is the impulse response of theextrapolator (with support on [0,1]) and the value<span class=tms>&#957;<SUB>k</SUB></span> is computed by the controllerat the moment <span class=tms>t&nbsp;=&nbsp;kT</span>. In practice,a zero-order hold is used almost everywhere,which fixes the output value during the sampling period:<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/gh_ut0.gif" WIDTH=238 HEIGHT=26 ALT=""></CENTER>so that its impulse response is given by<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/gh_ht0.gif" WIDTH=155 HEIGHT=23 ALT=""></CENTER>Nevertheless, sometimes more involved <I>generalizedholds</I> have some advantages (see <code>[1]</code>).The DirectSD toolbox supports generalized holds withimpulse response of the form<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/gh_ht.gif" WIDTH=211 HEIGHT=24 ALT=""></CENTER>where <span class=tms>A</span>, <span class=tms>B</span> and<span class=tms>C</span> are constantmatrices of compatible dimensions. Such a holdis specifiedas an LTI system with state-space realization(<span class=tms>A</span>, <span class=tms>B</span>,<span class=tms>C</span>, 0).<H3>Statement of the problem</H3>Consider the following sampled-data filtering problem.Stationary signal <span class=tms>r</span>(<span class=tms>t</span>) is described by spectral density<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/fil1_sw.gif" WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=48 ALT=""></CENTER>where &#969; denotes frequency. Measured signal is the sum ofthe reference signaland additive noise. Measurements are performed with period<span class=tms>T</span>, and noise is modelled as discretewhite noise with variance <span class=tms>0.01</span>. It is assumed thatthe signal and noise are independent.<p>The signal from adigital filter <span class=tms>K</span> is reconstructed into continuous-timesignal by a generalized hold curcuit <span class=tms>H</span>.The complete block-diagram of the system is shownbelow:<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/gh_scheme.gif" WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=148 ALT=""></CENTER>Here <span class=tms>w<SUB>r</SUB></span> and<span class=tms>w<SUB>n</SUB></span> areindependent unit continuous-time and discrete-time white noisesignals, respectivly;<span class=tms>F<SUB>r</SUB></span> and<span class=tms>F<SUB>n</SUB>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.1</span> denote transfer functions of theshaping filters associated with reference signal and noise,respectively.<p>The purpose is to findtransfer function of the optimal filer <span class=tms>K</span> such thatvariance of the continuous-time error<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/fil1_eps.gif" WIDTH=129 HEIGHT=21 ALT=""></CENTER>be minimal.<p>In order to improve filter quality, we will use generalized holdrather than usual zero-order hold.<H3>Preparing data</H3>Substituting -<I>s</I><SUP>2</SUP> for &#969;<SUP>2</SUP>,we find the spectral density as a function of <I>s</I>:<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/fil1_ss.gif" WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=48 ALT=""></CENTER>Using Matlab, we obtain<pre>   Sr = tf ( 4, [-1 0 4] )Sr: transfer function 1 x 1         -4      -------      s^2 - 4</pre>Therefore, the shaping filter can be found as a resultof spectral factorization using <code>sfactor</code><pre>   Fr = sfactor ( Sr )Fr: zero-pole-gain model 1 x 1        2      -----      (s+2)</pre><p>Then, it is necessary to construct a model of theplant in the standard sampled-data system.Operator equations have the form<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/gh_op.gif" WIDTH=169 HEIGHT=48 ALT=""></CENTER>Combining external signals into the input vector <span class=tms>w</span> = [<span class=tms>w</span><SUB>r</SUB> <span class=tms>w</span><SUB>n</SUB>]',we obtain the standard formwhere<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/gh_pij.gif" WIDTH=292 HEIGHT=66 ALT=""></CENTER>Such a system is formed as<pre>   Fn = 0.1;   sys = [Fr 0  -1          Fr Fn  0]sys: transfer function 2 x 3    !   -2              !    ! -----     0     1 !    !
