In this example we take<span class=tms>&#955;&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.3</span>,<span class=tms>&#969;<SUB>0</SUB>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.3</span> and<span class=tms>&#963;&nbsp;=&nbsp;7.25</span>.<p>The cost function is taken as<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/modh2_j.gif" WIDTH=109 HEIGHT=23 ALT=""></CENTER>where <SUB><IMG SRC="images/modh2_vpsi.gif" WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=18 ALT=""></SUB>and <SUB><IMG SRC="images/modh2_vu.gif" WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=18 ALT=""></SUB>denote the average variances of the signals<span class=tms>&#968;</span>(<span class=tms>t</span>)and <span class=tms>u</span>(<span class=tms>t</span>),respectively, and <span class=tms>&#961;<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4</span>is a nonnegative constant.This is equivalent to minimizingthe average variance of the output vector<span class=tms>&#949;</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;[<span class=tms>&#968;&nbsp;&#949;<SUB>u</SUB></span>].<p>It is required to find transfer function of the optimalcontroller <span class=tms>K</span> that minimizes this cost functionin the steady-state mode.The command signal <span class=tms>r</span> is assumed to be zero.It is necessary that controller compensate for persistent disturbance,i.e., include a network with integral-like action.<H3>Preparing data</H3>The known data can be entered as follows:<pre>   F1 = tf(0.0694, [18.22 1]);   F2 = tf ( 1, [1 0] );   lam = 0.3;   w0 = 0.3;   sigma = 7.25;   Fw = tf ( [2*lam*w0*sigma 0], [1 2*lam*w0 w0^2] );   T  = 2;</pre>For <span class=tms>r&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</span> operator equations ofthe system can be written in the form:<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/modh2int_op.gif" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=85 ALT=""></CENTER>so that the augmented plant forthe standard sampled-data systemappears as<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/modh2int_pij.gif" WIDTH=335 HEIGHT=86 ALT=""></CENTER>This system can be constructed as<pre>   rho = 2;   sys = [ F2*Fw  F2*F1             0     rho          -F2*Fw -F2*F1];</pre><H3>Full-order optimal controller</H3>To minimize the average variance of the outputwe use<code>sdh2</code><pre>   Kopt = sdh2 ( sys, T )Kopt: zero-pole-gain model 1 x 1      0.0029836 (z-3.719) (z-1) (z-0.896)      -----------------------------------      (z+0.2772) (z^2  - 1.841z + 0.8479)Sampling time: 2</pre>Compute the average error using<code>sdh2norm</code><pre>   err = sdh2norm ( sys, Kopt )err =    7.2492</pre>The closed-loop poles can be found as:<pre>   rOpt = roots(charpol(sys, Kopt))rOpt =  -0.2772   0.9204 + 0.0260i   0.9204 - 0.0260i   0.8960   1.0000</pre>Since a root at <span class=tms>z&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</span> is on the unitcircle, the system is marginally stable and cannot be used.This is caused by the fact that the pole of<span class=tms>F<SUB>2</SUB></span>at <span class=tms>s&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</span> is cancelled by thezero of <span class=tms>F<SUB>w</SUB></span> at the same point.<H3>Suboptimal controller with integrator</H3>Then, we find a suboptimal controller. Since the planthas order 2, we can find a controller of order 1. But onedegree of freedom must be spent on including integratingterm so that the minimal order of suboptimal controlleris 2. We also require that degree of stability be higherthan 0.02 and degree of oscillation be lower than 2:<pre>   ordK = 2;   alpha = 0.02;   beta = 2;</pre>Here <code>alpha</code> means minimal degree of stability and<code>beta</code> denotes the maximal degree of oscillation.<p>Then, we form a structure <code>option</code> and set the poles ofthe optimal controller as initial guess:<pre>   options.optPoles = rOpt;   options.dK0 = [1 -1];</pre>The second line indicates that controller transfer functionmust have a term <I>z</I>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 in the denominator(discrete model of integrator).<p>The suboptimal controller can be found using<code>modsdh2</code>:<pre>   [Kred,cost,x] = modsdh2 ( sys, T, ordK, alpha, beta, options )Kred: zero-pole-gain model 1 x 1      0.26409 (z-0.9878) (z-0.9489)      -----------------------------             (z-1) (z-0.9488)Sampling time: 2cost =    8.4792x =    0.9999         0    0.9999    0.0001</pre>Here <code>x</code> is the parameter-vector, eachcomponent of which may be changed independently inthe range [0,1]. Using this vector as an initial guess,we use local optimization to improve the controller:<pre>   options.paramGuess = x;   options.method = 'local';   [K,cost] = modsdh2 ( sys, T, ordK, alpha, beta, options )K: zero-pole-gain model 1 x 1      0.2638 (z-0.9878) (z-0.9492)      ----------------------------            (z-1) (z-0.9491)Sampling time: 2cost =    8.4768</pre>The closed-loop poles can be found as:<pre>   r = roots(charpol(sys, K))r =   0.9609 + 0.0001i   0.9609 - 0.0001i   0.9607 + 0.0001i   0.9607 - 0.0001i</pre>So we find a stabilizing controller that includes anintegrator (the term <I>z</I>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 in the denominator).<H3>References</H3><p><A name="ref1"></A>[1]&nbsp;Polyakov K., Rosenwasser E., and Lampe B., Two-level numerical procedure foroptimal design of digital modal controllers,<I>Proc. 44th IEEE Conf.
